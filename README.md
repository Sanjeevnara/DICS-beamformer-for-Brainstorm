# DICS-beamformer-for-Brainstorm
This is a DICS beamformer implementation for the Brainstorm (BS) software package. The dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) beamformer technique enables the study of cortical sources of oscillatory activation in frequency-domain (Gross et al., 2001). DICS is a linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer in the frequency domain. It estimates the covariance matrix to calculate the spatial filter using the sensor-level cross-spectral density (CSD) matrix and applies the filter to the sensor-level CSD to reconstruct the source-level CSDs of pairwise voxel activations, and this provides coherence measures between the source pairs.

This implementation has mainly focused on localizing induced activations due to task-MEG responses, eg, an overt definition naming language experiment.

To run the DICS-BF in BS,
1. Copy "process_ft_sourceanalysis_DICS_BF.m" to BS directory, '../brainstorm3/toolbox/process/functions/'
2. Open Brainstorm
3. Add (preprocessed epoched) trial responses to the processing window,<br/>

4. Select the DICS-BF source modelling from the process selection/Source/FieldTrrip: ft_souceanalysis DICS-BF, vXX, and Run, <br/>

7. Select the time interval of post-vs-pre responses, eg, [-0.3,0;0.7,1.2]<br/>
8. Select the frequency of interest, eg, f=22Hz; A dpss smoothing window of 4Hz is applied (by default, see vy_fft, line 656) to estimate cross-spectral density (CSD) matrix<br/>
9. Results after saving can be viewed in the last trial response.<br/>
